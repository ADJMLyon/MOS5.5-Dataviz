## **Tutorial 1 - Tableau Software**
Friday 12/01/2018 15:45-17:45

*Tableau Tutorial* 

1. The goal is to have a first experience with Tableau and build standard charts using a simple dataset.
2. Download and install [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) (Free) on your machine
3. (Simple) alternative to Tableau: [Polestar](http://vega.github.io/polestar/)

*Iris flowers visualization*

1. Download the [`iris.csv`](data/iris.csv) and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a **scatterplot** with X:sepal_length, Y:sepal_width, color:species and a trend line 
3. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Elections map*

1. Download the [`us-elections-history.csv`](data/us-elections-history.csv)` and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a grid plot with `Year` as columns, `State` as rows and `State Winner` as color/marks.
3. Save as a tab
4. Plot a **geo-map** with colors winning party in 2012 `Latitude (generated)` et `Longitude (generated)`, with `State` as shapes and color `ATTR([State Winner])`
5. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Stock markets visualizations*

1. Download the [`stocks.csv`](data/stocks.csv) and load it in Tableau; convert data types (if needed)
2. Plot a **multiple line chart** over time, for all stocks in a different color, grouped by company
3. Plot a **grouped bar chart** (companies as categories, grouped by year or by companies)
4. **Your own chart**!
5. Save as a tab and save the workbook

*Bonus*

* For each previous dataset, provide an alternative visualization.
* Find a more complex stock dataset with OHLC attributes (Open, High, Low, Close) and visualize intra-day variations
* Find more time points and companies and re-produce the previous charts; adapt accordingly.
* Use other markets data (e.g. BitCoin)
* Use other tools, e.g. Vega Lite to visualize the above or your dataset

ðŸ“… **For next class (19/01)**

  * `DATA.MD` lists all the datasources and details (e.g. volume of the data, how the dataset was created, copyright, etc.)
  * `PROCESSING.MD` describes the cleaning and preparation process to clean and shape your date
  * create a `index.html` that loads in d3 (e.g. `d3.csv`, ..) a first dataset (or sample of the dataset or an exepected dataset you create yourself). This will push you to have a first 

## Tutorial (2/2): Advanced layouts in D3.js

* Brief intro to D3 and Canvas ([example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/31ce330646fa8bcb7289ff3b97aab3f5))
* Class exercises: fork [this repository](https://github.com/LyonDataViz/MOS5.5-Dataviz) and focus on the sub-folder `tp-node-links` and the file `index.html`. The current version separates nodes in three random groups and highlight closest node to the mouse pointer. Add the following:
  - Group nodes by their group attribute (`d.group`).
  - Organize groups as a 2D grid ([example](http://blockbuilder.org/romsson/ba9181f7de7715022e166d3227087951)) by adding a `y` scale.
  - Link nodes nodes using `<line>` element ([example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045)) by adding data to the `graph.links` array. Look at the links drawing function for the expected data structure.
  - Highlight links connected to the current node, and the target nodes.
  - Adjust the `d3-force` parameters ([documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md)) ([example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320)).
  - BONUS
    - Load [The Miserable dataset](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) instead of fake data
